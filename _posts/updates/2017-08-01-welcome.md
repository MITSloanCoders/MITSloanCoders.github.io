Welcome

The MIT Sloan Coderâ€™s Club provides an accessible, results-focused forum for MIT Sloan students  and the broader MIT community to:
(1) Learn the basics of programming, and start building apps, websites, and services
(2) Engage in activities to build knowledge, such as hack-a-thons and hosted talks
(3) Better understand issues of software architecture, to promote better informed business leaders interested in the technology space
